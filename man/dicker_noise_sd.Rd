\title{Computing the noise variance in a high-dimensional linear model}
\usage{
dicker_noise_sd(W, z)
}
\arguments{
\item{W}{design matrix for high-dimensional linear model}

\item{z}{response in a high-dimensional linear model}
}
\value{
a nonnegative scalar of estimated noise standard deviation
}
\description{
Assume data are generated from the model z = W b + e, where e has independent components N(0, s^2), we estimate s^2 by using the method in Dicker (2014).  If the method fails, a fallback with nosie_sd will be used.
